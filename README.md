This extension places a download button next to songs on HypeMachine allowing you to download them!

It's super easy to install the extension by following these steps:

1 - Download the ZIP and extract it

2 - Go to Options -> Tools -> Extensions (Chrome wrench button)

3 - Enable Developer Mode 

4 - Click Load Unpacked Extension and select unzipped folder

5- You should now be able to click on the download arrow next to the songs and enjoy them later one !

I'd like to add thanks for everyone who's supported the extension and sent me thank you e-mails.

Cheers,
Farid Zakaria
